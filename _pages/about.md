I am current pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute advised by [Professor Agung Julius](https://julius-lab-rpi.github.io). My broad research interests include machine learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, and control systems. I am particularly interested in interpretable machine learning, neuro-symbolic learning, and their applications in time-series analysis, robotics, and control.

I am currently working on the following topics/projects:
- Interpretable Foundation Models for Time-Series Analysis
- Vision-based Embodied Agents
- Machine Learning Models for Human Circadian Rhythm Modeling and Entrainment
