2023-05-29	High-speed high-accuracy spatial curve tracking using motion primitives in industrial robots	2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	Industrial robots are increasingly deployed in applications requiring an end effector tool to closely track a specified path, such as in spraying and welding. Performance and productivity present possibly conflicting objectives: tracking accuracy, path speed, and motion uniformity. Industrial robots are programmed through motion primitives consisting of waypoints connected by pre-defined motion segments, with specified parameters such as path speed and blending zone. The actual executed robot motion depends on the robot joint servo controller and joint motion constraints (velocity, acceleration, etc.) which are largely unknown to the users. Programming a robot to achieve the desired performance today is time-consuming and mostly manual, requiring tuning a large number of coupled parameters in the motion primitives. The performance also depends on the choice of additional parameters: possible redundant degrees of freedom, location of the target curve, and the robot configuration. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimize the robot motion primitives for performance. The approach first selects the static parameters, then the motion primitives, and finally iteratively update the waypoints to minimize the tracking error. The ultimate performance objective is to maximize the path speed subject to the tracking accuracy and speed uniformity constraints over the entire path. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in simulation for ABB and FANUC robots for two challenging example curves, and experimentally for an ABB robot. Comparing with the baseline using the current industry practice, the optimized performance shows over 200% performance improvement.	"H.

2023-06-28	Motion Profile Optimization in Industrial Robots using Reinforcement Learning	2023 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	Path tracking problems are challenging with the absence of dynamic models and information about robot controllers. This paper presents a method of optimizing a motion profile constructed using a set of pre-defined motion primitives and a speed command to track a spatial trajectory with high accuracy, speed, and uniform motion using industrial robots. We use a bi-level optimization approach that optimizes execution accuracy using reinforcement learning and execution speed using bi-section search. We train and evaluate the reinforcement learning policy in simulation for an ABB robot. Experiment results demonstrate that the learned policy reduces the optimization cost to achieve the desired specifications. Additionally, the trained policy can generalize to trajectories not included in the training set.	"Y. Wen, H. He, A. Julius and J. T.

2023-05-01	Weighted Clock Logic Point Process	The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024	Datasets involving multivariate event streams are prevalent in numerous applications. We present a novel framework for modeling temporal point processes called clock logic neural networks (CLNN) which learn weighted clock logic (wCL) formulas as interpretable temporal rules by which some events promote or inhibit other events. Specifically, CLNN models temporal relations between events using conditional intensity rates informed by a set of wCL formulas, which are more expressive than related prior work. Unlike conventional approaches of searching for generative rules through expensive combinatorial optimization, we design smooth activation functions for components of wCL formulas that enable a continuous relaxation of the discrete search space and efficient learning of wCL formulas using gradient-based methods. Experiments on synthetic datasets manifest our model's ability to recover the ground-truth rules and improve computational efficiency. In addition, experiments on real-world datasets show that our models perform competitively when compared with state-of-the-art models.
